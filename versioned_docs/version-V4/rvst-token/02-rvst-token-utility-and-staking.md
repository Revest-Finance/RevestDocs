## Revest Fees and Staking Rewards
Clients using the Revest Protocol will pay a small up-front fee to create their FNFTs, based on the total value locked into them. The fee will be paid in ETH, and distributed among RVST holders. 99% of the fees that are generated by the Revest platform will distributed to RVST token holders who stake their tokens into the Revest Protocol and those who stake their RVSTs into the Revest LPs, and the remaining 1% will be piped into the Revest LPs initially, with future applications being left to the team. Half of the fees generated by the Revest platform will be distributed to Revest liquidity providers and the other half will be distributed to RVST holders staking their tokens.

## Staking
Revest liquidity providers and RVST holders will be given the opportunity to stake their tokens for a period of 1, 3, 6, or 12 months. Staking rewards increase non-linearly with the length of the staking period. More specifically, one month stakers will be able to capture 4% of the fees generated by the Revest platform, and 3, 6, and 12 month stakers will be able to capture a further 12%, 27%, and 56% of the fees generated by the Revest platform, respectively (see Table 1). If all RVST token holders stake their tokens for a period of 12 months, they will collectively receive 99%of the fees generated by the Revest platform during that period. With this reward structure, RVST stakers will ostensibly be able to recoup a significant share of the fees that they have incurred to create their FNFTs.

## Staking NFTs

RVST staking will be done through Staked FNFTs (S-FNFTs), a special form of time locked FNFT that may only contain RVST tokens. 

Staking rewards may be claimed at any point in time, and S-FNFTs may be freely transferred just as any other FNFT may be. Rewards are tied to the FNFT itself. 

Withdrawals may only be made from this FNFT in specific windows depending on the pool it belongs to. Longer staking periods will have longer withdrawal windows, and funds **can only be withdrawn within this window** for each cycle of the individual S-FNFT. Windows for each of the staking period are listed in **Table 2**. Revest stakers may also receive discounts on the fees that they will pay for minting their own FNFTs. Additionally, Revest partners integrating the Revest protocol to their platforms will receive a kickback of up to 50% of the fees that are generated by their clients on the Revest platform.

Example: 100 tokens staked on the 1st day of the month in the 1-month staking pool may  only be un-staked on the first day of the next month, and the month after that, and so on...

## Open Beta
The Revest Protocol will launch under an Open Beta for a period of 6-12 weeks, during which clients will be able to use the protocol and its tools for free. Staking rewards during this period will be distributed in the form of RVST tokens at a comparably attractive rate that will be reduced gradually over time, as user fees are being introduced. The Revest team is setting aside **2.5 million RVST** tokens for this purpose. At the end of the Open Beta period, users of the Revest Protocol will start paying a fee, which will be set by the Revest team based on extensive market research.

## Governance
In the spirit of decentralization and democratization underpinning the DeFi space, RVST holders staking their tokens will be granted the ability to participate in the governance of the RVST ecosystem and help shape the evolution of the Revest protocol. RVST stakers will have the opportunity to propose new initiatives aiming to further Revest Finance’s mission in the financial NFT space and may exercise their right to vote on the priority of new features being considered for the protocol. Members will cast their votes using an on-chain voting process. To be able to participate in the governance of the Revest ecosystem, S-FNFTs will need to have at least 27 days until maturity and be at least one day old. This mechanism ensures that only those with a vested interest in Revest may take part in decision prioritization that may greatly affect the project’s future success. This restriction will also offer protection against any future flash-loan attack vectors.
