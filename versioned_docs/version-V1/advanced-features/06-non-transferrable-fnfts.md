title: Non-Transferrable FNFTs
---

Non-transferability, when enabled, prevents an FNFT from being transferred by anyone except for the account that minted it. In practice, these FNFTs are designed for use in traditional vesting applications where the creator wants a fractionalized token locking solution, but does not want the transferability offered by typical FNFTs. 

This feature will disable all transferability of the FNFT following creation, apart from the minter's own wallet to another address or to the burn address. It may be toggled on in the advanced menu and is compatible with batch distribution.
