## Overview
Revest Finance proposes a new protocol for the packaging, transfer, and storage of fungible ERC-20 tokens as non-fungible tokenized financial instruments, leveraging the ERC-1155 Non-Fungible Token (NFT) standard for ease of access and universality of commerce. Using this product, ownership of underlying assets may be traded in ways that do not affect the value of the underlying asset, leading to a new meta-layer of commerce. Discover the mechanics, governance, and monetization of this protocol with targeted use-cases.

## Introduction

Revest Finance introduces a new protocol for the creation of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) backed by fungible ERC-20 tokens that will exist on leading blockchains. This new breed of non-fungible financial instruments, henceforth referred to as Financial Non-Fungible Tokens (FNFT), will form the backbone of the Revest protocol. Under this new protocol, fungible digital assets are deposited into a Revest smart contract in exchange for their non-fungible representation. The digital assets underlying the FNFT will remain locked in the smart contract until specific criteria spelled out in the contract by the FNFT’s creator have been met. Ownership of the FNFT itself may be freely transferred at any point prior to the smart contract’s maturity date, without affecting the market value of its underlying fungible tokens. The FNFT may be bought, sold, and traded on any platform which supports the ERC-1155 standard. 

When the FNFT “unlocks”, the fungible asset(s) underlying the FNFT may be liquidated by its owner in a wide variety of ways, such as spot markets. The unlocking criteria are spelled out in the smart contract by the FNFT’s creator. They may include the passage of a set period of time from the creation of the FNFT, the market value of the FNFT’s underlying asset(s) exceeding or falling below a predetermined threshold based on oracle-sourced price-feeds, or any combination of the two. 

There are many potential applications for this new FNFT protocol. The digital assets locked into the FNFT may be subject to a variety of vesting and dispersal restrictions associated with the introduction of new tokens. Typical vesting schemes prohibit the trading of any assets during their vesting period; to facilitate a wider range of trading options, the Revest protocol allows for trading of unvested assets without contravening vesting restrictions or affecting the market value of the assets, as only an NFT representing the future ownership of the unvested asset is transferred. The Revest protocol is also potentially useful for assembling and holding the collateral pool underpinning cryptocurrency-backed loans. 

Assets underlying the FNFTs may be forcefully locked to avoid spending prior to price increases or the passage of time. This mechanic may be used for anything from savings accounts, where additional assets may be deposited but not withdrawn, to inheritances, where the beneficiaries may be entrusted with assets that will not become available until many years into the future. Implementation of various decentralized finance (DeFi) standards allows for FNFTs to accrue interest over time, either collected into the underlying value of the FNFT itself, or deposited into the FNFT holder’s wallet. Digital assets deposited into FNFTs may be configured to execute trades automatically at the conclusion of a set period of time, resulting in the creation of a variety of decentralized long-term derivatives. Fees accrued through the creation of FNFTs will be distributed to Revest ERC-20 token (RVST) holders, who will be eligible for discounts when creating their own FNFTs.
